    <!-- Organized Code with Modules
    Native JavaScript modules are like ordinary JavaScript files with a few key differences. They should be loaded with the type="module" modifier. 
    Some developers prefer to use the .mjs suffix to distinguish them from other JavaScript source, but that is not required. Modules are unique in a few ways:

    By default, they are parsed and executed in “strict mode”
    Modules can provide exports to be consumed by other modules
    Modules can import variables, functions, and objects from child modules
    Modules operate in their own scope and don’t have to be wrapped in immediately invoked function expressions

    There are four steps in the lifecycle of a module.

        First, the module is parsed and validated
        Second, the module is loaded
        Third, related modules are linked based on their imports and exports
        Finally, modules are executed

    Any code not wrapped in a function is executed immediately in step 4.
